# Machine Learning Models From Scratch

There are two main goals for this repository. They are:
- Going deeper into the understanding of the popular machine learning models that are out there.
- Revising the underlying concept on how this models work.

> A man who truly understands can implement!

The first model would be the **K-Nearest Neighbours** which can be found in the [K-Nearest Neighbors](./K_Nearest_Neighbors.py)
