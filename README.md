# Machine Learning Models From Scratch

There are two main goals for this repository. They are:
- Going deeper into the understanding of the popular machine learning models that are out there.
- Revising the underlying concept on how this models work.

> A man who truly understands can implement!

# Dependencies
Numpy is the most essential tool that will be used. To get it up and running: 

```
# if installed already on the machine. If ModuleNotFoundError comes up then you would have to intall it.
import numpy as np

#If not already installed, on your terminal, input the command below.
pip install numpy
```


I would be using the visual studio code IDE to carry out this project, although anyone of your choosing is most welcome.

The first model would be the **K-Nearest Neighbours** which can be found in the [K-Nearest Neighbors](./K_Nearest_Neighbors.py)
The K-Nearest Neighbor is best described with the familiar quote "Birds of the same feathers flock together".
It is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification problems as well as regression problems
